### Array Methods with Callbacks

A few array methods use callbacks. For example `.map` - `.map` takes each element of an array and does something to it and returns a new arrays.

But what should it do? Multiply everything by 5? Capitalize everything? If `.map` had a hard-coded thing it always did with an array, it wouldn't be very flexible.

By allowing a callback to determine what happens to each array element we get a lot of flexibility and we can do some really powerful things.

Two arrays to work with

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0]

const panagram = ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']

```

The first question is for the numbers array. The second question is for the words array.

You don't have to write an answer to the thought questions.

#### Every

1. Determine if every number is greater than or equal to 0
1. determine if every word shorter than 8 characters

#### Filter

1. filter the array for numbers less than 4
1. filter words that have an even length

#### Find

1. Find the first value divisible by 5
1. find the first word that is longer than 5 characters

#### Find Index
1. find the index of the first number that is divisible by 3
1. find the index of the first word that is less than 2 characters long

#### For Each
1. console.log each value of the nums array multiplied by 3
1. console.log each word with an exclamation point at the end of it

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `forEach` method in a new array?

#### Map
1.  make a new array of each number multiplied by 100
1. make a new array of all the words in all uppercase

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `map` method in a new array?

#### Some
- Find out if some numbers are divisible by 7
- Find out if some words have the letter `a` in them


# Hungry for More

#### Reduce
- Add all the numbers in the array together using the `reduce` method
- concatenate all the words using reduce

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

#### Sort
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the numbers array?
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the words array?
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Sort the numbers in descending order
- Sort the words in ascending order
- Sort the words in descending order

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

### Array Methods Challenge Problems

#### isPanagram

Using the following array - test whether each letter a-z (case insensitive) is used at least once

```js
const panagram = ['The', 'quick','brown','fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
```


#### Working with data

- filter for products with a price that is less than 10, using the array below:
- sort alphabetically by product name

```js
const products = [
      {
        "name": "allen wrench",
        "price": 2.99,
        "description": "handy tool"
